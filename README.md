# dotfiles

Forked from https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.

Run `script/bootstrap` to get the configuration here copied/linked to system-appropriate directories.
Pretty easy. Thanks, Zach!

I just realized I've spent a bunch of time at home fiddling with the display preferences
and layout of my files and folders, and maybe slightly less time doing _exactly the same thing_
at work, only worse, because my preferences are constantly changing over time, plus
under time and attention constraints I still usually end up settling for something less than
exactly what I wanted.

After doing a little Google searching, it appears I owe many of the most useful configuration scripts
I use to Zach Holman. So, I have forked their repo as a starting point. With apologies to anyone
they ripped off without my knowledge. :D
